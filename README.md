- UI settings and delays
- Storage configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API Error" Messages**
- Verify your API keys are correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

**"No Ideas Extracted"**
- Try a more specific topic
- Check if the research results contain clear product opportunities
- The extraction uses fallback parsing if JSON parsing fails

**Slow Performance**
- Large topics may take longer to process
- Perplexity requests are rate-limited (1 second delay between calls)
- Complex research may require more processing time

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires modern browser with ES6+ support
- Uses Fetch API for HTTP requests
- Local storage for API key persistence

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored locally in your browser only
- No data is sent to external servers except the AI APIs
- All processing happens client-side
- Clear browser data to remove stored API keys

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Batch processing of multiple topics
- Custom prompt templates
- Integration with additional AI services
- Advanced filtering and categorization
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud storage integration
