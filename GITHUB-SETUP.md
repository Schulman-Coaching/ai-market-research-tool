# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## 🚀 Push to GitHub

Your project is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `AI-Market-Research-Tool`
5. Description: `AI-powered tool for automated market research and prototype generation using Gemini and Perplexity APIs`
6. Set to **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\elie\Development-Projects\AI-Market-Research-Tool"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Market-Research-Tool.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Verify Upload
Your repository should now contain:
- ✅ `index.html` - Main application
- ✅ `app.js` - Core logic
- ✅ `config.js` - Configuration
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation
- ✅ `SETUP.md` - Setup guide
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Security protection
- ✅ `api-keys.template.js` - API keys template
- ❌ `api-keys.js` - (Protected by .gitignore - good!)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your actual API keys in `api-keys.js` are protected by `.gitignore`
- Only the template file is uploaded to GitHub
- Anyone cloning your repo will need to create their own `api-keys.js` file
- This keeps your API keys secure while sharing the code

## 🌐 GitHub Pages (Optional)

To host your tool on GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch
5. Your tool will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/AI-Market-Research-Tool/`

**Note**: Users will need to enter their own API keys when using the hosted version.

## 📋 Repository Status

✅ **Local Git Repository**: Initialized and committed
✅ **Security**: API keys protected with .gitignore
✅ **Documentation**: Complete README and setup guides
